**healthcheck**

This is a healthcheck app, written in Java/SpringBoot. It is designed to be run either as a docker container or within a Kubernetes cluster (minikube, k3s,...) and helps me monitoring the outages of my DSL line. As I have an Intel NUC running 24x7, this is the perfect place for it.
There are probably _zillions_ of healthcheck apps out there, but I wanted to get started with SpringBoot as well...
So it's more a search for a problem than a solution :-)
